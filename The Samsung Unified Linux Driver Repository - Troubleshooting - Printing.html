<h3 id="0">P0. HELP!  I Updated the Packages and Now I Can't Print!</h3>
If you upgraded from a version lower than 4.01.17 to 4.01.17 or greater,
 you may need to uninstall and re-install your printer.  Otherwise, CUPS
 may not recognize the new ppd file and associated changes to the 
drivers (especially file names).  Doing so will solve errors reported by
 CUPS for files now found.  In other rare cases, something may not go 
smoothly in an upgrade process.  You can try uninstall all your packages
 from this repository and then reinstalling the ones you still need.  
Otherwise, post to <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/">the forums</a> for help.

<h3 id="1">P1. The Packages Are Installed but No Printer Is Configured</h3>
The packages do not autodetect printers, you will need to add it 
manually (using normal desktop environment tools to manage printing).  
In most modern distributions, the printer will configure itself once you
 initiate the printer setup process.

<h3 id="2">P2. Strange Text/Graphics Printing Artifact or Lockups With Certain Files (Particularly PDF)</h3>
This can be caused by several issues, but they essentially all relate to
 the generation of the postscript or SPL(-C) output going to the 
printer.  There are several possible solutions, but it is difficult to 
know in advance which is the best.
<ul><li>Installing the <i>suld-printer-pdf-fix</i> package may solve 
your problem if you meet the conditions described for it (but is not 
compatible with the driver2 packages). Manifestations that this may 
correct are an inability to print some or all pdf files while non-pdf 
files work correctly, extremely slow printing, or the printer refusing 
to print more than one document without being reset.  This may also 
address issues of "damaged" pdf output with missing characters, etc., 
but only in specific situations.  The package installs a work-around for
 the pdf/postscript converts by using cairo to generate the postscript 
or SPL-C output needed for the Samsung printers.  Print quality may 
suffer, and this package could potentially break your ability to print 
anything at all, and it may interfere with printing to non-Samsung 
printers while installed.  It is a hack, and so changes to several 
unrelated packages (CUPS, poppler, ghostscript) could invalidate the 
fix.  On the other hand, this is probably the easiest fix to try and 
solves several problems when it works, assuming you have the necessary 
dependencies installed (Ubuntu 12.04, Debian 7.0 Wheezy, or later).  
This fix is most likely to help with SPL(-C) printers, but may also work
 with postscript printers.  Credit for developing the fix goes to <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11965390&amp;postcount=952">b1b1 in the Ubuntu Forums</a>.</li>
<li>Another approach similar to the above that may be more general is given in <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/index.php?topic=5.0">in this thread by b1b1</a>.
  Although possibly more broadly applicable, this solution is not easily
 packaged and so (at least for now) must be applied manually.</li>
<li>Try a different driver version (install a different <i>suld-driver-*</i>
 package).  Although most printers work as well or better with the 
latest driver as one of the earlier ones, there are specific cases where
 an earlier driver may be superior.  This is why the earlier versions 
are still available.</li>
<li>Changing the printer drive to a related model sometimes helps, 
although it may introduce other problems, and it is not always clear 
what a "related" model is (usually similar model number, but not 
always).  This requires some trial and error, and the resulting 
printouts are often of mediocre quality.  This approach is best tried 
when large/color prints lock up the printer, but simple prints work 
fine.</li>
<li>It may be worth exploring alternative approaches (check the <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/alternatives.html">alternatives page</a>).
  In some cases, the generic printer option works surprisingly well to 
resolve occasional, small artifacts with printing from a pdf (especially
 with postscript printers).</li>
<li>Particularly for problems printing with LibreOffice, modifying the behavior of lpadmin <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/index.php?topic=63">as described here</a> may solve several printing issues.</li>
<li>If all else fails, post to <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/">the forums</a> in case someone else has solved the problem for your particular model.</li></ul>

<h3 id="3">P3. I am Unable to Print to a Network Printer Using IPP</h3>
Many Samsung printers do not properly support IPP.  If your printer is 
affected, you will need to connect to your printer using LPD or 
raw/socket protocols.  A (possibly incomplete) list of affected printers
 is: CLP-500, CLP-510, CLP-550, CLP-600, CLP-650, MFP-560, MFP-750, 
ML-1450, ML-1510, ML-1520, ML-1610, ML-1710, ML-1740, ML-1750, ML-2010, 
ML-2150, ML-2150, ML-2250, ML-2550S, ML-2550, ML-2560, ML-3560, ML-6060,
 ML-7300, SCX-4100, SCX-4200, SCX-4x16, SCX-4x20, SCX-4x21, SCX-6x20.  
Most of these printers are relatively old (first released in 2006 or 
earlier), but whether the problem has been fixed in later printers or 
the list is simply out of date, I don't know.<br><br>

Another type of IPP problem occurs in Ubuntu 12.04 with CUPS 1.5.2, and 
possibly other distributions, with printers not in the above list.  Some
 users apparently get it to work by updating to CUPS 1.5.3 or later 
releases.  At least in Ubuntu, an "ipp14" protocol has been introduced 
in addition to "ipp", to enable older ipp support for printers that do 
not work with the new ipp.  See <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cups/+bug/973270">this thread</a> and in particular <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cups/+bug/973270/comments/61">this comment</a>
 for more details and a ppa until official packages are released.  I do 
not know if these fixes will be incorporated back upstream into the CUPS
 project and propogate to other distributions.  As of CUPS 1.5.3, 
another workaround is <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/index.php?topic=147">described here</a> to activate and use the ipp14 protocol.

<h3 id="4">P4. The Color Balance Is Wrong</h3>
I don't actually know what causes this for some people with certain 
printers.  However, in at least some cases, using the driver as 
installed by this repository seems to work best.  In other cases, you 
might find better results with a direct install of the Samsung driver, 
the Foomatic driver, or a CUPS postscript driver.  I suspect it has 
something to do with exactly which libraries are being invoked, but 
beyond that it is still a mystery.

<h3 id="5">P5. My Printer Seems to Be Configured but I Can't Print</h3>
In some cases, what appears to be a properly installed printer will 
still fail to print (sometimes, but not always, when the printer is 
automatically installed by either Foomatic or the Samsung utilities).  
In that case, use the Configurator or a standard CUPS tool to check the 
printer properties, ensuring that the correct driver is actually 
associated with the printer, that the printer is "enabled", and that the
 printer is "accepting jobs" (the specific method for doing these varies
 a bit, but the names should apply).  If all else fails, simply delete 
the printer and add it as a new printer again, which will force a reset 
of all those settings.  

<h3 id="6">P6. How Do I Know I'm Using the Samsung Driver?</h3>
Go to the printer properties (there are various ways of doing this) and 
look at the Make/Model.  The Samsung drivers all have names in the 
format Samsung <specific model="" number="" or="" range="">Series 
&lt;(PS) or (SPL) or (SPL-C)&gt;.  In contrast, the Foomatic drivers all
 contain either "Foomatic" or "foo2qpdl" in the name, and SpliX drivers 
usually contain "splix" somewhere.

<h3 id="7">P7. My USB Printer Is Inconsistent or Fails to Print and I'm Using an Old Distribution</h3>
Occasionally and only in distributions released prior to 2008 (Debian 
4.x (Etch), Ubuntu 7.10 (Feisty) and earlier), the USB support will be 
quirky or broken using these packages.  I don't know why this is, but 
there isn't a good solution due to limitations in the way the Samsung 
drivers themselves work.  Your best bet is to update your distribution.

<h3 id="8">P8. My USB Printer Is Inconsistent or Fails to Print and I'm Using the <i>suld-scanner-usblp-fix</i> Package</h3>
This is a potential side effect of the usblp fix.  In some cases, you 
are stuck with being able to scan or print from the device, but not 
being able to access both functions together.

<h3 id="9">P9. Print Jobs Seem to Vanish and I'm Running SELinux</h3>
You may need to inform SELinux about the driver installation and correct
 file permissions, especially if you have installed the driver using the
 Samsung installer instead of the repository.  At least with Fedora, 
running the following (as root/sudo) appears to enable printing:<br>
restorecon -R -v /usr/lib64<br>
restorecon -R -v /usr/lib<br>
restorecon -R -v /usr/share<br>
Another solution may be to apply the SELinux policy file that Samsung 
has created for the 4.00.36 and 4.00.39 drivers, available <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/uld_policy.te">here</a>.
  If you know what to do with a file like this, or know how to use other
 SELinux tools to authorize the mfp backend to talk to CUPS, great.  If 
not, I cannot help you and you should investigate other resources for 
help (or post to the forum).

<h3 id="10">P10. My CJX-xxxx Printer Does Not Print</h3>
Do not install these packages or the Unified Driver at all, it will not work.  Instead, install the <i>printer-driver-c2esp package</i> (older distributions instead use the <i>c2esp</i>
 package) if it is not already present and set up your printer as a 
Kodak ESP printer.  This works for at least the CJX-1000, CJX-1050W, and
 CJX-2000FW.  If that package is not available for distribution, you can
 get it <a href="http://cupsdriverkodak.sourceforge.net/">here (I am not affiliated with it)</a>. 

<h3 id="11">P11. I Updated CUPS and Now I Can't Print</h3>
CUPS 1.5.3, such as in Ubuntu 12.04.1 and Debian Wheezy, does not get 
along well with the 3.00.xx drivers.  Update to a 4.xx.xx version.  If 
you are using a current version, post to the forums.

<h3 id="12">P12. Print Jobs Seem to Vanish and/or the Printer Just Blinks, and I'm Not Running SELinux</h3>
For at least some printer models, forcing a test page to print (via a 
tool like system-config-printer) and/or manually printing a text file 
seems to clear the issue from the printer.  To manually print a text 
file, issue the command:<br>
lp -d printer-name a-text-file<br>
where printer-name is the installed printer name and a-text-file is some simple text file.  <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/index.php?topic=59.0">See this post</a>
 for a slightly more detailed example; the approach has been reported to
 work by several users.  Some applications also apparently have trouble 
with certain network setups: see <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/index.php?topic=19.msg939#msg939">this post</a> to determine if this situation applies to you.

<h3 id="13">P13. I Am Unable to Add a Printer Using the Configurator</h3>
The simplest solution is to just not use the Configurator to add the 
printer.  Use one of the default system tools or the CUPS web interface 
instead.  However, depending on the exact behavior, there may be another
 solution:
<ul>
<li>If the add printer dialog crashes after you click "Next" when it 
first pops up, the problem is a conflict or error in some versions of 
libmfp.  This occurs with the driver versions 4.00.36 and 4.00.39, but 
seems not to be a problem with earlier or later versions.  So if you can
 switch driver versions, the add printer routine will probably work.</li>
<li>If the add printer dialog seems to work, but no printers are found, 
there is no known simple fix.  If you also cannot detect the printer 
using other interfaces, then the issue is hardware, permissions, or the 
connection between the computer and printer.  If the other interfaces 
work, just use those.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="14">P14. I Am Unable to Add a Printer Using Any Interface</h3>
The first thing to try is unplugging and replugging the cable, to clear 
any static building or other random interference.  Then, if the printer 
is connected by USB, try a different USB port.  If shift cables does not
 help, it is probably an issue with the printer itself or the USB 
libraries in your distribution.  Detection that the printer exists at 
all, especially when connected by USB, is not a process that involves 
the printer driver itself.

<h3 id="15">P15. Printing Causes rastertospl Errors</h3>
This may be due to hard-coded references to having this file in 
/opt/smfp-common/printer/lib.  This could occur in driver 4.01.17 and 
all driver2 versions.  A possible solution is to create a symlink: ln -s
 /usr/share/cups/filter/rasterspl 
/opt/smfp-common/printer/lib/rastertospl (might need sudo and/or 
creating the opt directories first).  If you encounter this and it 
solves the problem, please post to the forum, as this is a rare error 
that has been hard to isolate because it is specific to certain printers
 using certain settings.
