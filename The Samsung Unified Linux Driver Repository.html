<h1>The Samsung Unified Linux Driver Repository</h1>

This site provides an apt (.deb) repository for installing the Samsung 
Unified Linux Driver in a more user-friendly and less problematic way 
than downloading and installing directly from the Samsung website or 
using the installer that ships with printers.  I simply repackage the 
drivers that Samsung provides for free, and am not involved in any way 
with development of them.  The drivers are binary-only (no source code 
provided), and are only available for the Intel/AMD 32- and 64-bit 
platforms with limited ARM support (Android, Raspberry Pi, etc. only if 
"soft-float").

<h2>News</h2>
<h3>8 July 2018</h3>
The SULDR (and all of bchemnet.com) will be shutting down in May 2019.  I
 no longer have the time or ability to keep up with hosting it.  In 
addition, it is unlikely that HP will be updating any drivers for the 
Samsung-branded printers, and many drivers already fail to work 
correctly with new Linux distributions.  Finally, for those with a 
Samsung printer less than ~10 years old, the newest drivers available 
for download from the HP website work just as well, if possibly not 
quite as conveniently, as the repackaged versions here.<br><br>
If anyone is interested in taking over some or all of this content, I am
 willing to assist in that process.  Post in the forums expressing 
interest.<br><br>

<h3>12 May 2018</h3>
Driver version 1.00.39 is available.  This is the last version prepared 
by Samsung, and the first released by HP after the acquisition was 
completed.<br><br>

<h3>14 May 2016</h3>
Updated key signing.  This will cause a keyring package to be installed,
 and may cause a temporary warning about missing a signature until that 
package is installed.  Instructions for setting up repository have been 
modified to reflect the new approach.  The old samsungmfp-* packages 
have also been removed.<br>
<br>For older news, see below.<br><br>

<h2>Setting Up the Repository</h2>
<ol><li>If you performed any installations of the Unified Linux Driver 
performed using the Samsung installer, these must be completely removed 
before using the .debs in this repository.  See the <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/suld.html">uninstallation information</a> for your version of the driver.</li>
<li>Do one of the following to enable the repository (all are equivalent).
<ul><li>Using the terminal:
<ul><li>To /etc/apt/sources.list (root/sudo access required to edit), add the line:<br>
deb http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/ debian extra</li>
<li>Enter the following in a terminal (as root):<br>
bash -c 'echo "deb http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/ debian extra" &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list'<br>
Or if using sudo:<br>
sudo bash -c 'echo "deb http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/ debian extra" &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list'</li>
</ul></li><li>Or using a graphical package manager (Synaptic, Ubuntu Software Center, etc.): 
<ul><li>Edit the repository settings (e.g., Synpatic go to Settings -&gt; Repositories) to add:<br>
deb http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/ debian extra</li>
<li>Or if multi-line input is required:<br>
URI: http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/<br>
Distribution: debian<br>
Section: extra</li>
</ul></li></ul></li>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> The distribution and section must be entered <i>exactly</i>
 as above.  Do not substitute the name of your own distribution, 
translate the words, or use a default section - it won't work.  I get 
hundreds of errors on the server each day from people who replace one or
 more of the terms above (especially Ubuntu users using the code name of
 their particular release).<br>
<b>ALSO IMPORTANT (Ubuntu of any flavor, Mint based on Ubuntu, and other Ubuntu derivatives)</b>: Make sure that you add the repository as an "Additional Repository".  Do not add as a "PPA", that will not work.<br><br>
<li>Refresh your repository listings:
<ul><li>On a terminal (as root):<br>
apt-get update<br>
Or if using sudo:<br>
sudo apt-get update</li>
<li>Or in a graphical manager, click the reload or refresh button.</li>
The suld-* packages should now appear in your list of available packages to install.
You will likely see an error about unathenticated packages.</ul>
</li><li>Install the repository key (last update: 24 Nov 2016) for the 
repository by installing the suldr-keyring package.  This package will 
also automatically be installed if you install any driver file.  Once it
 is installed and you refresh your repository listings again, you will 
not receive warnings about authentication.<br><br>
If you are unable to install the keyring package this way due to authentication errors, <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/pool/debian/extra/su/suldr-keyring_2_all.deb">download it directly</a> and then:
<ul><li>On a terminal (as root):<br>
dpkg -i suldr-keyring_2_all.deb<br>
Or if using sudo:<br>
sudo dpkg -i suldr-keyring_2_all.deb</li></ul>
Then refresh the repository.</li></ol>

<h2>Selecting Packages to Install</h2>
This is a quick guide to get most people up and running.  If you need 
additional information, look at the question pages linked at the top of 
this page or the <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/repository.html">repository information</a>.  <b>Note
 to long-time users or those following older forum posts about packages:
 the samsungmfp-* packages have been replaced by suld-* and are somewhat
 simplified.</b>
<ul><li>To install the driver for printing and scanning (if your printer
 has a scanner), select one of the suld-driver-* packages to install.  
Chances are that the latest package, <i>suld-driver2-1.00.39</i>, will work for you.  If you have an older printer or if you experience problems, <i>suld-driver-4.01.17</i> or <i>suld-driver-4.00.39</i> will probably work.  Check the <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/supported.html">list of supported printers</a>
 if the driver does not seem to be working for you.  Regardless of the 
particular package installed, you will then need to set up the printer 
using any printer management tool (the default one in your distribution,
 the CUPS web interface, or the Samsung Configurator).</li>
<li>If you want to use Samsung's graphical interface for managing the 
printer/scanner (instead of the default printer and scanner management 
tools in your distribution), you can install one of the 
suld-configurator-* packages.  (If using the <i>driver2</i> packages, the Configurator is not available, and you will have to use a distribution tool.)  Most people will probably want <i>suld-configurator-2-qt4</i>.  However, if you want the slpr print interface or you want/need the Qt3 version, select the alternate appropriate version.</li>
<li>If you want to use the slpr print interface of the Configurator, 
which intercepts print jobs and prompts you for additional print 
controls, install the <i>suld-slpr</i> package.  Note, however, that this requires installing either <i>suld-configurator-1-qt4</i> or <i>suld-configurator-1-qt3</i>, because the newer Configurator versions do not include this utility.</li>
<li>If you have an old printer connected via a parallel port, you will need to install <i>suld-parallel</i>.
  (Note that 4.00.39 and earlier drivers support parallel ports; 4.01.17
 and all driver2 versions do not.)  Do not install this package if your 
printer is connected via USB or a network connection.</li>
<li>The <i>suld-printer-pdf-fix</i> and <i>suld-scanner-usblp-fix</i> 
packages are possible workarounds if you encounter difficulties printing
 pdf files or connecting to the scanner function of your printer when 
using a USB cable, respectively.  Only install these after encountering 
problems, as they may also cause other problems if they are not needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
Thanks to the many users, both in the original Ubuntu Forums thread and 
the current forums, who have provided feedback and helped with testing 
over the years.  I don't even know how many are still using this driver,
 but thanks to all of you.  Particular users who have contributed 
solutions that I've incorporated into the repository packages or 
alternative solutions include hokiejp (eglibc 64-bit solution, for 
network scanning); gaboro (eglibc 32-bit solution testing for the same 
problem); Rodolfo Medina (ppd-only solution guide); tapanit (work-around
 for scanning across complex networks); n3ck and ezekiel_quacks (USB 
scanning work-around solutions); rlar (network scanning broadcast 
solution); vyvee (usblp fix); b1b1 (pdf to ps printing problems fix).  
Some of the solutions described in these web pages come from these 
individuals and may point to their original posts, but even those who 
solved problems that are now irrelevant have my thanks.  More recently, 
angelnu and totally-king have developed the scripts in the suld-scantopc
 packages.

<h2>Older News</h2>

<h3>27 December 2015</h3>
Driver version 1.00.37 (December) is posted as a Samsung installer but 
not packaged in repository.  The only differences compared to 1.00.36 
are 4 ppd files for obscure printers.<br>

<h3>25 December 2015</h3>
Release of packages for the 1.00.36 (October) drivers.  The binaries are
 unchanged, the only actual changes are to the ppd files, so 
driver2-1.00.35 and driver2-1.00.36 are effectively identical.  Also 
made a few other changes to add some additional printer support and 
hopefully fix some miscellaneous problems a few people have reported.

<h3>2 May 2015</h3>
Release of packages for the 1.00.35 (March) drivers.  This drops support
 for ARM and provides a huge number of updates to ppd files, including 
to several printers that had not been well supported for the past 
several versions.  Actual binary changes appear to be minor.

<br><br>

<h3>29 November 2014</h3>
Release of packages for the 1.00.27 (August) and 1.00.29 (November) 
drivers.  These appear to be very similar to the 1.00.21 driver, but 
there are subtle (and entirely untested by me) differences.  I also 
resolved some issues with the 1.00.21 for a small number of printers 
impacted by the binary changes from 1.00.06 to 1.00.21; Samsung also 
fixed this issue with the 1.00.27 release.

<br><br>

<h3>4 May 2014</h3>
Release of packages for the new 1.00.21 driver.  This is a minor update 
to the 1.00.06 series (see below) that adds support for a few additional
 printers, but also seems to change some of the binaries significantly. 
 I have no idea if it is actually an improvement.

<br><br>

<h3>6 October 2013</h3>
Release of packages for the new 1.00.06 driver.  These packages are 
marked as "driver2" to address the confusion associated with Samsung 
re-starting their version numbering.  These packages should be treated 
as experimental at this stage - they have had precisely zero in-house 
testing, because I do not have a system to do more than ensure they 
install.  The Configurator is no longer shipped by Samsung, and is not 
compatible with this version.  So anyone who regularly uses the 
Configurator should not upgrade.  Parallel port support has also been 
removed, and support for a few printers (beyond those already dropped in
 4.01.17) was removed.  The latest printers released from Samsung are 
supported by this driver.  There is also limited support for the arm 
architecture.  Specifically, the armel/soft float architecture.  The arm
 drivers do not yet work with armhf/hard float.  The new drivers work 
quite differently, and I will be updating the support content on this 
site as time allows to reflect the changes.  As usual, post to the 
forums to share any experiences.

<br><br>
Note that the 1.00.06 driver installer from Samsung seems to work fine, 
and there is currently no seriously compelling reasons to use this 
repository instead of Samsung's installer (unless you want an alternate 
driver version or an easy install/uninstall system).

<br><br>

<h3>15 May 2013</h3>
Addition of the <i>suld-scantopc</i> and <i>suld-scantopc-gui</i> 
packages for enabling the push-to-scan feature of at least some Samsung 
multifunction printers.  Consider these packages experimental, and share
 any issues in <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/index.php?topic=73.0">this thread</a>.  

<br><br>

I have also completed a migration to a new web host, without any 
apparent major issues.  But do let me know through the forums if 
something seems broken.

<br><br>

<h3>3 May 2013</h3>
Major website update and repository overhaul, as well as release of 
packages for the 4.01.17 driver.  In particular, note that many packages
 (especially packages related to scanning) have been incorporated 
directly into the driver package, simplifying installation.  <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/repository.html#rename">Click here</a> if more information is needed on changes to the repository.  Also new is a list of <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/supported.html">printers supported by different driver versions</a>. 

<br><br>

<h3>29 September 2012</h3>
Driver packages updated.  Driver versions 4.00.36 and 4.00.39 are now available.

<br><br>

<h3>10 June 2012</h3>
I have just launched <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/">new forums</a> on this website to provide a mechanism to ask for help, provide feedback, etc.  These will gradually replace the original <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=341621">Ubuntu Forums thread on this topic</a>
 that was started way back in January 2007.  (Update 27 May: the 
Ubuntuforums thread is now closed.)  When you register, you will be 
asked to report a Linux version and printer type; this is to simplify my
 responses to threads, so I can at-a-glance remember the parameters for 
someone I am replying to.
