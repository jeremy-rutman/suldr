<h1>Samsung Installer Information</h1>

If you are planning to work with the Samsung driver directly, you should
 usually download it directly from Samsung.  However, for those who want
 the versions that match what I'm using in the repository and/or are 
having trouble finding a download from Samsung that is appropriate for 
their printer (although a different model download usually works fine), 
you can download selected versions here:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/driver/UnifiedLinuxDriver-1.00.39.tar.gz">version 1.00.39 (driver2)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/driver/UnifiedLinuxDriver-1.00.37.tar.gz">version 1.00.37 (driver2)</a> (this version not available through repository)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/driver/UnifiedLinuxDriver-1.00.36.tar.gz">version 1.00.36 (driver2)</a></li>

If you find yourself with some need to install manually instead of using
 the repository, please share why this is so and I will attempt to 
modify the repository to address the problem.  (Even non-Debian users 
can convert the packages and install them manually.)  As far as I know, 
there is no advantage to installing directly and many disadvantages.
<br><br>
You are on your own if you choose to use these versions.  Samsung at 
least nominally provides support for issues you may experience with 
them, and there are too many variables for me to address the many 
problems.  If you choose to install using one of these installers rather
 than repository, you can certainly still post to the forums here for 
help.  However, my first suggestion will always be to install using the 
repository, which controls for and addresses many of the issues you may 
encounter with the Samsung installer.

<h2>Uninstallation Instructions</h2>
If you want to know specific details of what files are installed or how 
to uninstall particular versions of the driver installed the Samsung 
way, see the page specific for the version that you downloaded and 
installed:
<ul><li><a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/smfpv2.html">Version 2.00.xx (very old)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/smfpv3.html">Version 3.00.xx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/smfpv4.html">Version 4.00.xx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/smfpv401.html">Version 4.01.xx</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/smfp2v1.html">Version 1.00.xx (driver 2)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Update for Driver2 (1.00.xx)</h3>
The problems below seem largely resolved with the new style driver 
released by Samsung in 2013.  The only significant remaining issues are 
that a few non-critical files (such as the ppd files) end up with 
executable permissions, there is no uninstall routine available if the 
original download from Samsung is deleted (the uninstall script is not 
installed), and there are still a couple of quirks regarding how the 
scanner system is set up in /etc/.  Otherwise, use of this repository 
instead of the Samsung installer for that version is largely a matter of
 preference or convenience.   The Samsung installer has no extraneous 
libraries and places everything neatly into /opt/, with links as needed 
from the /usr/ directories to /opt/, and uninstalls cleanly.  Most users
 can use the 1.00.xx Samsung installer directly without need for this 
repository.

<h2>General Problems With the Samsung Installer/Uninstaller</h2>

<h3>Files Left Behind</h3>
The uninstaller can't tell if certain files should be deleted or not, and so usually leaves them in /usr/lib:
<ul>
<li>/usr/lib/libtiff.so.3* (provided by package libtiff3, which was replaced by libtiff4 in 2005, but is required for ImageManger)</li>
<li>/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5* (provided by package libstdc++5) (all versions before 4.01.xx)</li>
<li>/usr/lib/libcups.so (symbolic link to libcups.so.2)</li>
<li>/usr/lib/libqui.so* (provided by package libqt3-mt) (all versions before 4.00.xx)</li>
<li>/usr/lib/libqt-mt* (provided by package libqt3-mt) (all versions before 4.00.xx)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Installer and Uninstaller Routinely Fail</h3>
Depending on the exact combination of Qt3 and Qt4 libraries on your 
computer, one of several errors could occur when trying to run the 
uninstaller that results in the inability to automatically remove the 
driver.  This is more of a problem with the v2.00.xx and v3.00.xx 
installers than it is for later versions.  There are also issues with 
various installer and uninstaller versions if the path contains any 
spaces.

<h3>Inappropriate Printer Selection</h3>
Many versions of the installer automatically install a printer, which 
may or may not match your actual printer model.  In some cases, this 
installed printer does not actually work and needs to removed, then your
 actual printer configured again.

<h3>Replacement of /usr/bin/lpr</h3>
Prior to the 4.01.xx installer, the Samsung installer moves /usr/bin/lpr
 to /usr/bin/lpr.org and writes /usr/bin/lpr as a link to 
/opt/Samsung/mfp/bin/slpr, which (a) breaks the cups-bsd (or cupsys-bsd)
 packages, (b) can itself be overwritten when the CUPS package is 
updated and it writes back to /usr/bin/lpr, and (c) breaks non-graphical
 and automated applications, because slpr requires a graphical 
environment and user intervention.

<h3>Parallel Port Interference</h3>
The Samsung installer writes parallel port information to 
/etc/modprobe.conf, which then blocks reading of /etc/modprobe.d/, and 
so all blacklists or other hardware support configurations present in 
/etc/modprobe.d/ are ignored.  In addition, computers without physical 
parallel ports sometimes exhibit odd behavior due to this forced 
parallel support.

<h3>Inappropriate Permissions and Ownership</h3>
Many of the files installed to /usr/lib/ end up with 777 permissions: 
i.e., world-writable and world-executable.  Even non-executable library 
files are given these permissions.  Other files occasionally have 
inappropriate group ownership assigned.  The result is a possible 
security risk to your system.  Both of these issues vary quite a bit, 
not only with the particular installer version but even within 
apparently identical downloads from Samsung.

<h3>Apparent Unavailability for Many Printers</h3>
Samsung has recently decreased the number of printers that they provide 
an official driver for, even though they do in fact still support them 
(for example, the CLP-550N no longer provides a Linux driver for 
download at the Samsung USA site, even though it had for years prior to 
that point and the new drivers still work).  In addition, many different
 versions of the Linux driver are present on their site, and exactly 
which version you get depends on which printer model you search for.

<h3>Library Conflicts</h3>
There are occasional library conflicts with modern Linux distributions, 
although not as bad as with the v2 or earlier v3 installers.  I have 
largely fixed these in my packages available through the repository, but
 you may run into problems if you install directly from Samsung and are 
using either a brand-new or somewhat older distribution version.  Known 
potential sources of conflict if you perform a manual install include 
libc6, qt3 libraries, libstdc++5, libnetsnmp, and libtiff.
