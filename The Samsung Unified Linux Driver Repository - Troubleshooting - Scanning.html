<h1>Common Issues Specifically Related to Scanning</h1>

Before trying to troubleshoot scanning, please make sure you are using the latest version of the driver <b>from the repository</b>.  For network-connected scanners, it is particularly important that the <i>suld-network-*</i>
 package be up to date.  If you installed the driver manually, you are 
on your own; there are too many library conflicts for scanning to be 
reliable, and many problems specific to particular releases of the 
driver from Samsung (such as mixing 64-bit and 32-bit installations).  
The repository addresses most of them, and I won't provide details here 
on how to reconstruct all of them manually (that information is 
available in various locations on this website and in the provided 
links.
<br><br>
Solutions to scanning problems depend on how the scanner is connected 
(USB, network, or parallel) and specific details of where the 
communication breakdown is, so the approaches below are broken down 
accordingly.  I also highly recommend that you ensure you can print to 
your printer before worrying about scanning; if you can't print, you are
 almost certainly going to be unable to scan, and most of the 
suggestions below assume you have already sorted out how to get printing
 working.

<h3 id="0">S0. HELP!  I Updated the Packages and Now I Can't Scan!</h3>
On rare occassions, something may not go smoothly in an upgrade process.
  You can try uninstall all your packages from this repository and then 
reinstalling the ones you still need.  Otherwise, post to <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/">the forums</a> for help.

<h3 id="1">S1. The Scanner of a Multifunction Printer Doesn't Work</h3>
Make sure you have followed <b>all</b> the following steps, or no other fix will have any success:
<ul><li>You have installed a <i>suld-driver-*</i> package that is listed as <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/supported.html">supporting your printer</a>.</li>
<li>If your printer/scanner is connected over the network, you may benefit from having one of the <i>suld-configurator-*</i> packages installed.</li>
<li>You have added yourself to the "lp" group, for example when 
installing the driving (you may have been prompted or silently added if 
you were not already in the group) or by entering "sudo usermod -G lp -a
 <your user="" name="">" in a terminal, and then logging out and back in
 to your session (or rebooting).  (Under specific circumstances with 
newer distributions, this is not actually required, but it almost always
 improves success rates.)</your></li>
<li>In some rare cases, you may also need to be a member of the "saned" group, similarly to the "lp" bit above.</li>
<li>Have you tried to access the scanner using "sudo" or as the root 
user?  (For example, the "superuser" version of the Configurator 
available in your menu.)  In rare cases, this appears to be the only 
solution.</li></ul>
Once you have completed these steps, and if your scanner still does not 
work, proceed to the appropriate next question.  In some cases, a 
different <i>suld-driver-*</i> versions may help, but testing this is 
not a strict requirement of proceeding to other solutions.  Some 
scanners may only work with particular driver versions, although this is
 relatively rare.

<h3 id="2">S2. USB-connected Scanner Is Not Recognized by sane-find-scanner</h3>
If you enter "sane-find-scanner" in a terminal and do not get output 
indicating that your computer "sees" your scanner, you can try the 
following:
<ul><li>Install the <i>suld-scanner-usblp-fix package</i>.  This is most
 likely to be effective if you are using CUPS 1.5.0 (Ubuntu 11.10), but 
may also be useful for later distributions/CUPS versions.  Earlier CUPS 
versions are highly unlikely to be improved with this fix.  Essentially,
 this fix ("hack") works around the new blacklisting of the usblp 
module.  The downside is that re-activating that module may interfere 
with printing, to the same or other printers, although usually it works 
okay.  Printers that may benefit from this approach can print, but not 
scan.</li>
<li>In certain older versions of Debian/Ubuntu, mainly released around 
2009-2010, there are specific printers that benefit by temporarily 
removing the USB 2.0 kernel module.  To test this, run "sudo modprobe -r
 ehci_hcd" in a terminal, then try to scan.  If it works, you will need 
to perform this command each time you wish to enable the scanner.  When 
done scanning, run "sudo modprobe ehci_hcd" in a terminal to re-enable 
other USB devices.</li></ul>

<h3 id="3">S3. USB-connected Scanner Is Recognized by sane-find-scanner But Does Not Work</h3>
If you enter "sane-find-scanner" in a terminal and do get output 
indicating that your computer "sees" your scanner, but xsane or 
"scanimage -L" or similar programs do not recognize the scanner, you can
 try the following:
<ul><li>Ensure your printer/scanner is connected to a main (usually 
powered) USB port, not a hub or secondary port.  This is most often a 
problem with external hubs or monitor ports, but occasionally it happens
 even when connecting directly to a computer.  If this is the problem, 
printing will usually work fine, but scanning will fail.</li>
<li>Ensure that libusb-0.1 is installed (automatic if using repository, 
but otherwise may not be by default on modern distributions).</li>
<li>You can try the <i>suld-scanner-usblp-fix</i>, described in the previous question, but it will only work in rare cases, even if you apparently meet all the criterea.</li>
<li>You can try to apply the Xerox backend fix for a printer not covered
 by the package, using the information output from sane-find-scanner.  
To do this, take the "ID" value output from sane-find-scanner, which 
will be something like 04e8:####.  Add the following line to the end of 
/etc/sane.d/xerox_mfp-smfp.conf (without quotes): "usb 0x04e8 0x####", 
replacing #### (and 04e8 if needed) with the actual values.  Then add 
the following to the file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-libsane-samsungmfp.rules:<br><br>
ACTION!="add", GOTO="label_end"<br>
SUBSYSTEM!="usb_device", GOTO="label_end"<br>
ATTRS{idVendor}=="04e8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="####", ENV{libsane_matched}="yes"<br>
LABEL="label_end"<br>
<br>
Changing #### (and 04e8 if needed) to the appropriate values again.<br>  Note that you will need to have the <i>suld-driver-common-*</i>
 package installed, or else create the indicated files manually.  That 
package already includes support for all printers marked with "Xerox 
MFP" (without a "*") on the <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/supported.html">supported printers list</a>.  Models with the "*" may work if manually applied.  Other models without any indication may also work, but probably won't.</li>
<li>With Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04, and possibly other distributions, there
 have been scattered, inconsistent reports of problems with the USB 
subsystem.  This is not specific to Samsung.  In some cases, devices 
work when plugged into a USB 2.0 port but not a USB 3.0 port; in other 
cases, unplugging other USB devices may enable the scanner.  If you 
encounter issues of this type, you should file a bug report with your 
distribution.</li></ul>

<h3 id="4">S4. Which Printer Models Work With Which Scanning Driver?</h3>
<a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/supported.html">Click here</a> 
for supported models.  Most supported USB models work through standard 
libsane libraries and utility varies with the libsane version; you can 
get updated information <a href="http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html#Z-SAMSUNG">here</a> and <a href="http://www.sane-project.org/cgi-bin/driver.pl">here if you search for "samsung"</a>.
  Some additional printers appear to be supported by foomatic to varying
 degrees.  This is erratic, version-dependent, and sometimes breaks 
later.  Additional support cannot easily be forced, but you can try the 
previous the answer to the previous question.

<h3 id="5">S5. USB-connected Scanner Is Inconsistent/Often Fails and I'm Using an Old Distribution</h3>
Occasionally and only in distributions released prior to 2008 (Debian 
4.x (Etch), Ubuntu 7.10 (Feisty) and earlier), the USB support will be 
quirky or broken using these packages.  I don't know why this is, but 
there isn't a good solution due to limitations in the way the Samsung 
drivers themselves work.  Your best bet is to update your distribution. 
 Most of the above solutions are only available with newer distribution 
releases.  Although less common, distributions released prior to 2010 
also are often best dealt with simply by updating the whole system, as 
several kernel versions between 2.6.33 and 3.0 seemed to have problems 
with CONFIG_USB_DEVICES="n" being set during compilation, but effects 
are highly erratic, and better work-arounds usually exist if you have 
more recent system libraries installed.  One potentially useful approach
 that may still of interest is described <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/488274/comments/10">here</a> and with more details and a script <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9018954&amp;postcount=434">here</a>.

<h3 id="6">S6. Network-connected Scanner Is Not Recognized by netdiscovery (driver 3.00.xx to 4.01.xx)</h3>
First, make sure that you are using the most recent version of the <i>suld-network-1</i> or <i>suld-network-2</i>
 package.  Second, run the following command in a terminal: 
"/opt/Samsung/mfp/bin/netdiscovery --all --scanner".  If it reports a 
scanner found and the model matches yours, then you should be ready to 
go; if not, post to the <a href="https://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/">forums</a>.
  On the other hand, if 0 scanners are found (in recent versions, only 
the line "# DEBUG: Network printers discovery utility" will appear) or 
the model is incorrect, you need to consider the following:
<ul><li>Do you have a firewall running?  You need to allow incoming UDP 
packets from the printer, on all ports.  Configure this through whatever
 firewall interface you are using.</li>
<li>In some cases, the netdiscovery broadcast fails.  To test this, run 
"/opt/Samsung/mfp/bin/netdiscovery -s --snmp" and see if snmp_send fails
 as network unreachable.  If so, read the solution and details described
 in <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11322969&amp;postcount=800">rlar's post</a>.</li>
<li>Network scanning requires that your computer be on the same IPv4 
local area network as the printer (same network segment, so that the all
 the "x"s in x.x.x.??? are the same for your computer and the scanner 
and there are not multiple routers between the two).  <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/index.php?topic=35.msg140#msg140">There is a work-around for this issue</a> which is derived from <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10482031&amp;postcount=656">here</a> and <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10482037&amp;postcount=657">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7">S7. Parallel-connected Scanner Is Not Working</h3>
Good luck.  I suggest updating to a newer model printer.

<h3 id="8">S8. My CJX-xxxx Printer Does Not Scan</h3>
I am not aware of any method for supporting this printer, but have very limited information.

<h3 id="9">S9. My Scanner Worked Until I Updated to Ubuntu 12.04</h3>
There appears to be some subtle conflict with some (many?) printers and 
the Qt4 libraries if you scan using the Configurator interface (or 
smfpscan directly).  Until I have time to track down the actual problem 
and possibly identify a solution, a simple fix is to install <i>suld-configurator-*-qt3</i> instead of the default <i>suld-configurator-*-qt4</i>.  The interface isn't as pretty, but otherwise it works the same (and it works with scanning under Ubuntu 12.04).

<h3 id="10">S10. Imagemanager Will Not Start</h3>
Newer releases of the Qt4 Imagemanager must be given a valid image file 
as a command parameter when starting.  After that it works fine.  This 
will be observed in the <i>suld-configurator-2-qt4</i> package but not in other versions.

<h3 id="11">S11. Network-connected Scanner Is Not Working</h3>
In some cases, network connected scanners using the Xerox MFP backend 
may benefit from replacing USB information in /etc/sane.d/xerox_mfp.conf
 with the IP address of the printer.  See <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/index.php?topic=9.msg329#msg329">this post</a>
 for the (little) available information.  At least with driver2 
versions, setting SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE to 'smfp:net;xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' 
where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP address of your printer can solve 
problems with multiple network interfaces causing detection problems.  
See <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/index.php?topic=19.msg939#msg939">this post</a> for additional information regarding setting up xerox_mfp.conf for some printers.

<h3 id="12">S12. smfpnetdiscovery (driver2 v1.00.xx) Produces No Output</h3>
This appears to be its normal mode.  Unlike the older netdiscovery, 
smfpnetdiscovery does not seem to produce any human-readable output, 
whether or not the printer is detected.

<h3 id="13">S13. USB scanner not working with USB 3.0 port</h3>
A SANE update (1.00.27, Ubuntu 17.10 or later) may require enabling an 
environment variable to allow a USB 2.0 printer/scanner to work on a USB
 3.0 port.  See <a href="http://www.bchemnet.com/suldr/forum/index.php?topic=330.new">this forum topic</a>.
